                <p>ZombieChain also known as ALGORAND BLOCKCHAIN 
                    is a cryptocurrency protocol that
                    offers blockchain-based pure proof-of-stake. 
                    The name of its native cryptocurrency is ALGO.
                    The platform was intended to provide a broad range
                    of safe, effective, and scalable applications in
                    addition to being autonomous and decentralized.
                    It is a blockchain platform with great potential
                    that provides a novel solution to the problems
                    of decentralization, security, and scalability.
                    It is an appealing option for both developers
                    and users due to its creative design and dedication
                    to sustainability.

                    <p>The Algo is the native cryptocurrency of Algorand.
                       Ten billion Algo were created during the Algorand
                       blockchain's inception. There are about 6.9 billion
                       Algo in circulation as of September 2022, which are
                       dispersed through various ecosystem support programs
                       and community incentives.

                     <p>Algorand's main goal is to realize the potential
                        of blockchain technology on a global scale by 
                        utilizing open source software and the Algorand 
                        protocol to create an ecosystem that is inclusive.
                        Algorand wants to enable new business models, 
                        produce a new generation of blockchain apps,

                     <p>Silvio Micali is the creator of Algorand. 
                        He teaches computer science at the Massachusetts
                         Institute of Technology (MIT) and is an Italian. 
                         Information security and cryptography are the main 
                         topics of Micali's study at the MIT Computer Science 
                         and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Algorand's 
                         creative use of blockchain technology has been greatly
                         influenced by his knowledge of distributed systems
                          and encryption. He is among the leading experts in the 
                          world in cryptography, computer science, and mathematics.

                    <p>Algorand addresses several technological issues like:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Performance</b>: Unlike other L1 blockchains, 
                                Algorand has always placed a high priority
                                 on performance, beginning with the immediate 
                                 finality of transactions.</li>
                            <li><b>Usability</b>: By enabling the usage of Python, 
                            one of the most widely used programming languages,
                             Algorand has made it simpler for developers to build 
                             on its platform. This broadens the application of Algorand's 
                             blockchain technology and creates new opportunities.
                            </li>
                             <li><b>Decentralization</b>: To improve its decentralization, 
                                Algorand has implemented two revolutionary enhancements. 
                                It switched to a peer-to-peer (P2P) gossip network and 
                                introduced the incentive of consensus. These modifications 
                                increase the autonomy of the chain and provide Algorand 
                                users additional authority.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Scalability</b>: Algorand has created a distinctive, 
                                    scalable architecture that maintains the security 
                                    and decentralization aspects of blockchain technology. 
                                    Many applications, including the creation of carbon 
                                    credit exchanges and the acceleration of real estate 
                                    transactions, have been made possible by this design.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
