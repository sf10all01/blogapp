          <p>
            Algorand blockchain is a cryptocurrency protocol that offers
            blockchain-based pure proof-of-stake. The name of its native
            cryptocurrency is ALGO. The platform was intended to provide a broad
            range of safe, effective, and scalable applications in addition to
            being autonomous and decentralized. It is a blockchain platform with
            great potential that provides a novel solution to the problems of
            decentralization, security, and scalability. It is an appealing
            option for both developers and users due to its creative design and
            dedication to sustainability.

            The Algo is the native cryptocurrency of Algorand. Ten billion Algo
            were created during the Algorand blockchain's inception. There are
            about 6.9 billion Algo in circulation as of September 2022, which
            are dispersed through various ecosystem support programs and
            community incentives.

            Algorand's main goal is to realize the potential of blockchain
            technology on a global scale by utilizing open source software and
            the Algorand protocol to create an ecosystem that is inclusive.
            Algorand wants to enable new business models, produce a new
            generation of blockchain apps, and promote human advancement on a
            global scale.

          <p style="display: inline; padding: 0 0 0 2rem;">
            Silvio Micali is the creator of Algorand. He teaches computer
            science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is an
            Italian. Information security and cryptography are the main topics
            of Micali's study at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial
            Intelligence Laboratory. Algorand's creative use of blockchain
            technology has been greatly influenced by his knowledge of
            distributed systems and encryption. He is among the leading experts
            in the world in cryptography, computer science, and mathematics.

          <h2>Technology</h2>
          <p class="post-meta">Published on May 14, 2024 by Zombie Land</p>
          <p>Algorand addresses several technological issues like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Performance</b>: Unlike other L1 blockchains, Algorand has
              always placed a high priority on performance, beginning with the
              immediate finality of transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Usability</b>: By enabling the usage of Python, one of the most
              widely used programming languages, Algorand has made it simpler
              for developers to build on its platform. This broadens the
              application of Algorand's blockchain technology and creates new
              opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Decentralization</b>: To improve its decentralization, Algorand
              has implemented two revolutionary enhancements. It switched to a
              peer-to-peer (P2P) gossip network and introduced the incentive of
              consensus. These modifications increase the autonomy of the chain
              and provide Algorand users additional authority.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Scalability</b>: Algorand has created a distinctive, scalable
              architecture that maintains the security and decentralization
              aspects of blockchain technology. Many applications, including the
              creation of carbon credit exchanges and the acceleration of real
              estate transactions, have been made possible by this design.
